# Predictive-Maintenance

Predictive maintenance is the application of data-driven, approaches to examine equipment status and anticipate when repair should be conducted.


The objective of the project is to detect component deterioration at very early stages and reduce production downtime due to equipment failure. We have designed a web app to perform predictive maintenance. The web app acts as a predictive analysis tool for plant supervisors to monitor equipment conditions and predict maintenance.
